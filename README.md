# ‚öîÔ∏è PyBattle: The Ultimate Coding Battle Arena üêç

**PyBattle** is a gamified web application designed to transform monotonous programming practice into an engaging, challenge-driven experience for beginners learning **Python**. By integrating game mechanics like levels, coins, and leaderboards, it aims to boost motivation, retention, and problem-solving skills in a fun and interactive environment.

This project was developed for the partial fulfillment of a university academic requirement (TYBBA(CA), Savitribai Phule Pune University, 2024-2025).

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Gamified Learning:** Progress through levels, earn **coins (rewards)**, and track your performance on the **Leaderboard**.
* [cite_start]**Multiple Battle Modes:** Test a variety of coding skills with four unique game types[cite: 79, 144]:
    * [cite_start]**Spot the Error:** Debug faulty Python code snippets[cite: 145].
    * [cite_start]**Write Code Under Time:** Solve problems under a countdown timer to build speed[cite: 146].
    * [cite_start]**Output Challenge:** Predict the exact output of given Python code[cite: 146].
    * [cite_start]**Quiz Master:** Theory-based multiple-choice questions on fundamental concepts[cite: 147].
* [cite_start]**User Authentication:** Secure registration and login system for personalized progress tracking[cite: 112].
* [cite_start]**Dashboard & Analytics:** Visual representation of user progress, levels cleared, and coins earned across all modes[cite: 119, 152].
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Content:** Game content (levels, questions) is managed and loaded dynamically from **JSON files**, making content addition easy[cite: 176, 398].
